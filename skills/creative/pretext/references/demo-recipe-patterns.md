# Demo Recipe Patterns

> Source: creative/pretext/SKILL.md — split 2026-09-10.

The community corpus (see `references/patterns.md`) clusters into a handful of strong patterns. Pick one and riff — don't invent a new category unless asked.

| Pattern | Key API | Example idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Reflow around obstacle** | `layoutNextLineRange` + per-row width function | Editorial paragraph that parts around a dragged cursor sprite |
| **Text-as-geometry game** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line collision rects | Breakout where each brick is a measured word |
| **Shatter / particles** | `walkLineRanges` → per-grapheme (x,y) → physics | Sentence that explodes into letters on click |
| **ASCII obstacle typography** | `layoutNextLineRange` + measured per-row obstacle spans | Bitmap ASCII logo, shape morphs, and draggable wire objects that make text open around their actual geometry |
| **Editorial multi-column** | `layoutNextLineRange` per column + shared cursor | Animated magazine spread with pull quotes |
| **Kinetic type** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line transform over time | Star Wars crawl, wave, bounce, glitch |
| **Multiline shrink-wrap** | `measureLineStats` | Quote card that auto-sizes to its tightest container |
