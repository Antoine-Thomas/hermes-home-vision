### Style/Genre Description Field

FORMULA (adapt as needed):
  Genre + Mood + Era + Instruments + Vocal Style + Production + Dynamics

```
BAD:  "sad rock song"
GOOD: "Cinematic orchestral spy thriller, 1960s Cold War era, smoky
       sultry female vocalist, big band jazz, brass section with
       trumpets and french horns, sweeping strings, minor key,
       vintage analog warmth"
```

DESCRIBE THE JOURNEY, not just the genre:
```
"Begins as a haunting whisper over sparse piano. Gradually layers
 in muted brass. Builds through the chorus with full orchestra.
 Second verse erupts with raw belting intensity. Outro strips back
 to a lone piano and a fragile whisper fading to silence."
```

TIPS:
- V4.5+ supports up to 1,000 chars in Style field — use them
- NO artist names or trademarks. Describe the sound instead.
  "1960s Cold War spy thriller brass" not "James Bond style"
  "90s grunge" not "Nirvana-style"
- Specify BPM and key when you have a preference
- Use Exclude Styles field for what you DON'T want
- Unexpected genre combos can be gold: "bossa nova trap",
  "Appalachian gothic", "chiptune jazz"
- Build a vocal PERSONA, not just a gender:
  "A weathered torch singer with a smoky alto, slight rasp,
   who starts vulnerable and builds to devastating power"

Put tags in BOTH style field AND lyrics for reinforcement.
Keep to 5-8 tags per section max — too many confuses the AI.
Don't contradict yourself ([Calm] + [Aggressive] in same section).

### Custom Mode
- Always use Custom Mode for serious work (separate Style + Lyrics)
- Lyrics field limit: ~3,000 chars (~40-60 lines)
- Always add structural tags — without them Suno defaults to
  flat verse/chorus/verse with no emotional arc
