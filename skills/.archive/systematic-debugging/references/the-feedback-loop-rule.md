# The Feedback Loop Rule

> Source: software-development/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md — split 2026-09-10.

The feedback loop is the debugging work. Before reading code to build a theory, create or identify a **tight** command that can go red on the user's exact symptom and green when the bug is fixed. A tight loop is fast, deterministic, agent-runnable, and specific enough to catch this bug — not merely "doesn't crash".

When a clean repro is hard, spend disproportionate effort building the loop. Guessing without a red-capable loop is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.
