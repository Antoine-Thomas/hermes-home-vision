# Simplify Code — Parallel Review & Cleanup

Review your recent code changes with four focused reviewers running in
parallel, aggregate their findings, and apply the fixes worth applying.

**This is a cleanup pass, not a bug hunt.** You are improving the quality of
code that already works — removing duplication, flattening needless
complexity, cutting waste, and deepening band-aid fixes. Do not go hunting
for correctness bugs here; that's what `requesting-code-review` is for.

**Core principle:** Four narrow reviewers beat one broad reviewer. Each one
deeply searches the codebase for a single class of problem — reuse, quality,
efficiency, altitude — without diluting its attention across all four. They
run concurrently, so you pay the latency of one review, not four.


## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user says any of:

- "simplify" / "simplify my changes" / "simplify these changes"
- "review my code" / "review my recent changes" / "clean up my changes"
- "/simplify" (if they're carrying the Claude Code habit over)

Optional modifiers the user may add — honor them:

- **Focus:** "simplify focus on efficiency" → run only the efficiency reviewer
  (or weight the aggregation toward it). Recognized focuses: `reuse`,
  `quality` (also accepts `simplification`), `efficiency`, `altitude`.
- **Dry run:** "simplify but don't change anything" / "just report" → run the
  four reviewers, present findings, apply NOTHING. Ask before applying.
- **Scope:** "simplify the last commit" / "simplify staged" / "simplify
  src/foo.py" → narrow the diff source accordingly (see Phase 1).

Do NOT auto-run this after every edit or tack it onto the end of unrelated
tasks. It costs four subagents' worth of tokens — invoke it only when the
user explicitly asks.
