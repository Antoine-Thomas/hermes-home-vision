## Background rules (the whole point)

1. **Never `raise_window=True`** unless the user explicitly asked you
   to bring a window to front. Input routing works without raising.
2. **Scope captures to an app** (`app="Chrome"`) — less noisy, fewer
   elements, doesn't leak other windows the user has open.
3. **Don't switch virtual desktops / Spaces.** cua-driver drives
   elements on any virtual desktop / Space regardless of which one is
   visible.
4. **The user can be on the same machine.** They might be typing in
   another window. Don't grab focus. Don't pop modals to the front.
