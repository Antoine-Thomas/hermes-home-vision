## Delivering screenshots to the user

When the user is on a messaging platform (Telegram, Discord, etc.) and
you took a screenshot they should see, save it somewhere durable and
use `MEDIA:/absolute/path.png` in your reply. cua-driver's screenshots
are PNG or JPEG bytes (mimeType is on the response); write them out
with `write_file` or the terminal (`base64 -d`).

On CLI, you can just describe what you see — the screenshot data stays
in your conversation context.
