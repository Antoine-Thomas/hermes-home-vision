## Page content is a separate toolset

`computer_use` is desktop-only: it does not expose a typed route for browser
page content (no `cua_browser_*` actions). For reading or acting on a page's
DOM — navigation, clicking a link by text, typed input into a form field —
use the separate `browser_navigate`/`browser_click`/`browser_type`/`browser_snapshot`
tools (or `browser_exec` when the Browser Use CLI backend is active); their
own schemas document the current contract. Reserve `computer_use` for browser
*chrome* (the address bar, permission prompts, extension popups, native
dialogs) and anything else on screen that isn't page content.

### Key shortcuts vary per platform

Use the host's idiomatic modifier:

| Common action | macOS | Windows / Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Save | `cmd+s` | `ctrl+s` |
| New tab | `cmd+t` | `ctrl+t` |
| Close tab / window | `cmd+w` | `ctrl+w` |
| Copy / paste | `cmd+c` / `cmd+v` | `ctrl+c` / `ctrl+v` |
| Address bar | `cmd+l` | `ctrl+l` |
| App switcher | `cmd+tab` | `alt+tab` |

When in doubt, capture and look for menu hints, or ask the user which
shortcut to use.
